# Hi👋 
Welcome! 

# About
To wrap my third year as a biomedical engineering student at the Unviversity of Waterloo, I am currently on exchange in England🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿! I am an affiliate with the mechanical engineering department at University College London and I will be here until the end of 2022 (very excited to experience a true London Holiday season). If you have any sightseeing or food recommendations, please do let me know :D


Over the course of my undergraduate studies, I am interested in the application of computational biochemistry 
& wearable robotics to improve accessibility in healthcare🩺. 

Sometime next year, I'm hoping to run my very first half marathon–most days you can find me either training for that or recovering with lots of ice🏃‍♀️. In my freetime, I'm usually reading or secretly reviewing restaurants–all before an 8 PM bedtime of course.

# Contact 
I am always open to opportunities for collaboration or a coffee chat so feel free to shoot me a message at clare.wei@uwaterloo.ca or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clare-wei/)!
