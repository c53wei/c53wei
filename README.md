# Hi👋 
Welcome! Here, you will find some valiant attempts at expanding the mighty tech toolbelt. 

# About
I have recently completed my second year of biomedical engineering at the University of Waterloo.
Over the course of my undergraduate studies, I am interested in the application of computational biochemistry 
& wearable robotics to improve accessibility in healthcare🩺

In my freetime, you can find me exploring the great outdoors🏕, trying samples at Costco🍟, 
or if it's a rainy day–curled up with a book🤓!

# Contact 
I am always open to opportunities for collaboration or a coffee chat so feel free to shoot me a message at clare.wei@uwaterloo.ca or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clare-wei/)!
