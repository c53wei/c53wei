👋 Hi and welcome to my GitHub! Here, you will find many valiant attempts at expanding the mighty tech toolbelt. 

My name is Clare and I am currently in my second year of biomedical engineering ﹫ the University of Waterloo.
Over the course of my undergraduate studies, I am interested in the application of computational biochemistry 
& wearable robotics to improve accessibility in healthcare🩺

When I need a break from poor sitting-posture or brain-usage, you can find me exploring the great outdoors🏕, trying samples at Costco🍟, 
or if it's a rainy day–curled up with a book🤓!

I am always open to opportunities for collaboration or a coffee chat so please feel free reach me at clare.wei@uwaterloo.ca!
