# Hi👋 
Welcome! 

# About
I am in my last year of engineering at the University of Waterloo. I am currently seeking hardware engineering roles in the automotive and biomedical equipment industry.

Currently I am at the peak of half marathon preparation–most days you can find me either training for that or recovering with lots of ice🏃‍♀️. In my freetime, I'm usually reading or secretly reviewing restaurants–all before an 8 PM bedtime of course.

# Contact 
I am always open to opportunities for collaboration or a coffee chat so feel free to shoot me a message at clarejwei@gmail.com or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clare-wei/)!
