# Hi👋 
Welcome! 

# About
I've just finished my third year of biomedical engineering at the University of Waterloo. Over the course of my undergraduate studies, I am interested in the application of computational biochemistry & wearable robotics to improve accessibility in healthcare🩺. 

Sometime next year, I'm hoping to run my very first half marathon–most days you can find me either training for that or recovering with lots of ice🏃‍♀️. In my freetime, I'm usually reading or secretly reviewing restaurants–all before an 8 PM bedtime of course.

# Contact 
I am always open to opportunities for collaboration or a coffee chat so feel free to shoot me a message at clare.wei@uwaterloo.ca or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clare-wei/)!
